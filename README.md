# ci

This is an opinionated set of tools/libraries aiming to generalise CI across
my personal nix-built projects, so I can get CI for my projects without
configuring them individually. It is currently very feature-light and under
active[^1] state of development, and only really open-sourced so I can use it
without making it difficult to build my personal projects.

I don't necessarily intend this to be widely useful, though you are welcome to
reference/adapt/seek inspiration from it for your own personal CI stack (under
the terms of the license[^2]).

As a personal utility, I haven't really documented it extensively, and don't
really plan to.

[^1]: (as active as a weekend project can be).
[^2]: See LICENSE.txt for proper license terms.
